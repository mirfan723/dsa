Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input symbols based on their frequency in the data. It constructs a binary tree where frequently occurring symbols have shorter codes. During compression, the tree is traversed to encode the input, reducing the overall bit representation. During decompression, the tree is used to decode the compressed data. This approach ensures efficient encoding and decoding, making Huffman coding widely used in various data compression applications.
