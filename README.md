Huffman compression is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the data. More frequent characters receive shorter codes, leading to efficient compression. This method is widely utilized in file compression formats like ZIP and JPEG, offering a balance between compression ratio and computational complexity.
